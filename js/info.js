      '<p>House for the watchman and his family with a living room, dining, kitchen, two bedrooms a bathroom and a laundry patio positioned in a corner lot of 62 square meters. On one hand a house was sought that with very few elements could be appropriated by a family as a dignified home, and on the other hand be able to build it in the fastest and most efficient way possible with the constructive system. The walls on the lower and upper level are colored integrated apparent blocks, jalcreto and concrete joists slabs (common construction system in Jalisco), polished concrete floors, pine wood dividing walls and steel window frames.<p/>',

      '<p>The house is shown as a monolithic box closed to the exterior; however, it is opened to an interior patio for the social area. A low wall, a steel fence and an apparent concrete canopy vestibule the entry from the exterior. The stair opening interrupts the concrete joists with a steel beam and produces a doble height space that dignifies going upstairs where the pine wood dividing walls give warmth to the vestibular space before entering both bedrooms. The laundry patio is veiled with a lower wall and is semi covered by the same continuous canopy from the entryway. Through the modulation, meeting of the elements and the play between textures and materials, we sought to achieve both the greatest simplicity and spatial quality.<p/>'

      '<p>Project overview. The project is located in Huangmuchang Village, Zhangjiawan Town, Tongzhou District, Beijing. There is no farmland here, but it is more like the back garden of Beijing. With the small houses with a similar appearance, white walls, and red windows, the 600-year history of the Royal New Village can still be felt here. The building is located in an eye-catching position in the northwest of the village. It is a two-story brick-concrete building, originally used as a residential office. Atelier d’More was commissioned to renovate the space, as the sleep Institute’s first B&B project near Beijing Universal Studios. The weather-beaten exterior walls and wind-blown eaves are eager to be refurbished and restored.<p/>',

      '<p>The architectural intention of creating a landscape. Given the lack of scenery in the surrounding environment, we decided to create an inward view and create an interesting private garden, which led to the idea of the enclosed courtyard space. Only a few viewing frames are opened on the south wall. In addition to the blue sky and white clouds, the chaos and noise are isolated from the wall. The large glass windows of the building actively introduce the scenery and light of the courtyard, becoming a part of the indoor space experience.<p/>'

      '<p>Text description provided by the architects. Casa Batlló is a homage to the light of the Mediterranean: its light, shadow, and colors of the sky and sea. The central courtyard captures all that Mediterranean light and distributes it vertically to all the corners of the house, no matter how remote they are. The color gradation from darker to lighter blue doses the light in its vertical travel and makes sure it does not lose its pigments. <p/>',

      '<p>Envisioning the interior for an existing emergency stair, that also had to be transited by every single visitor of Casa Batlló, appeared as a very difficult challenge to address. It was by relating the vertical development of this stair with the presence of the central patio, both piercing the house from top to bot­tom and organizing the main fluxes of the visit, that we saw the possibility to establish a dialog between them. This space we have designed for the stair poses a reflection and a dialog with the patio of Casa Batlló. <p/>'

      '<p>Egret Bay art museum is located in Rizhao, Shandong Province. It is located at the east foot of Wulian mountain, a famous Buddhist mountain. Mr. Su Dongpo visited the mountain many times during the reign of the governor of Mizhou, and left a good sentence of "its beauty does not reduce the wild geese". The construction concept of the town is to "reshape the relationship between man and nature". On a land area of 10000 mu, it combines the aesthetic space with the natural landscape and various business forms. After more than ten years of construction, it seems to be an ideal place for people to live. In the early spring of this year, Mr. Xu qunde, the founder of egret Bay, went on an outing with me. I talked to him about a building I had built before. There was a process photo. In the picture, there was a woven curved steel mesh floating lightly in the woods hidden by mist. Seeing this picture, Mr. Xu immediately said that there was a place in egret bay where one could be woven, which was located in the cherry blossom Valley mentioned above. Mr. Xu wants to build a building in the center of Cherry Valley as a place for music, dance, drama, and other artistic activities. He described to me that his ideal state is "nature is the best", the cherry tree is the main body, and the architecture is hidden in it. The two form a perfect relationship. As I understand it, this building is like a small thatched canopy hidden in deep mountains and lakes in Chinese landscape painting, facing the landscape with an elegant attitude, and taking nature as the soul.<p/>',

      '<p>Using steel bars as the only material and weaving them into buildings by hand in three-dimensional space has high technical difficulty. The method I adopt is to make the warp first, that is, the upper and lower lines, the spacing or equal distribution of the warp, or close arrangement or gradual change, and then make the weft after the warp is completed. The weft is better to be less. It should play a role in tying the stability of the structure or interweaving with the warp into a diamond pattern, or a free and soothing wavy line. The shaping of shape and the organization of lines should first follow the stability of the structure, followed by the characteristics of steel bars. All steel bars are bent manually by craftsmen without any mechanical bending. Thirdly, follow the guidance and overall planning of beauty, and try to make the trend of each line beautiful and the shape woven is also beautiful.<p/>'
